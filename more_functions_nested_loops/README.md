This repository contains Holberton More Functions and Nested Loops (C Projects and low level programming exercises) 

For additional information, refer to Holberton Week 4 - C More Functions and Nested Loops Module 

0-isupper.c: Write a function that checks for uppercase character.
1-isdigit.c: Write a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).
2-mul.c: Write a function that multiplies two integers.
3-print_numbers.c: Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
4-print_most_numbers.c: Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
5-more_numbers.c: Write a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.
6-print_line.c: Write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.
				You can only use _putchar function to print
				Where n is the number of times the character _ should be printed
				The line should end with a \n
				If n is 0 or less, the function should only print \n
7-print_diagonal.c: Write a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.
8-print_square.c: Write a function that prints a square, followed by a new line.
				  Prototype: void print_square(int size);
				  You can only use _putchar function to print
				  Where size is the size of the square
				  If size is 0 or less, the function should print only a new line
				  Use the character # to print the square
9-fizz_buzz.c: Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.
				Each number or word should be separated by a space
				You are allowed to use the standard library
